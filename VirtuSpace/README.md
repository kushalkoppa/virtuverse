# VirtuSpace

VirtuSpace is the unified platform for simulation and virtualization within VirtuVerse Studio, containing V-Orchestrator, EnviHub, and PlantHub.

## Overview

VirtuSpace serves as the simulation and virtualization hub for:
- **V-Orchestrator**: Simulation orchestration and workflow management
- **EnviHub**: Virtualization and simulation tools
- **PlantHub**: Plant simulation and manufacturing tools

## Sub-Platforms

### V-Orchestrator
Simulation orchestration platform that manages and coordinates simulation workflows:
- Open-loop and closed-loop simulations
- Workflow coordination and scheduling
- Resource allocation
- Results tracking and integration with V-Analyzer

### EnviHub
Comprehensive platform for virtualization and simulation tools:
- IPG CarMaker integration
- MATLAB Simulink support
- Model library management
- External collaboration
- Model editor and validator

### PlantHub
Advanced platform for plant simulation and manufacturing tools:
- Plant simulation tools
- Manufacturing process models
- Factory layout planning
- Production optimization
- Process simulator

## Architecture

VirtuSpace acts as a container platform that:
- Hosts V-Orchestrator, EnviHub, and PlantHub
- Provides unified navigation between platforms
- Aggregates data from all sub-platforms
- Serves as the simulation hub within VirtuVerse Studio

## Getting Started

See the main VirtuVerse Studio documentation for setup instructions.
