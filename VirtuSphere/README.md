# VirtuSphere

VirtuSphere is an analytics and monitoring platform within VirtuVerse Studio that provides visualization and insights for simulations and platform usage, along with DevContainer generation capabilities.

## Overview

VirtuSphere contains:
- **V-Analyzer**: Grafana-based dashboard platform for simulation data visualization and platform metrics
- **V-DevContainers**: DevContainer generation tool for quick development environment setup
- **SmartHarness**: AI-enabled component providing intelligent insights and recommendations

## Purpose

VirtuSphere serves as the analytics hub for:
- Simulation results visualization
- Platform usage metrics
- Performance monitoring
- Trend analysis

## Components

### V-Analyzer
